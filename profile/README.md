We aim to provide next-generation JavaScript programming systems which have never been seen before. Our flagship project is System G2. The G2 project is a JavaScript virtual machine, compiler, and M:N threading system which allows programs to execute concurrently and/or in parallel. The main motivation of G2 is to generate a standard multi-CPU parallel computing system and library for JavaScript.

Tasklet is described in the second generation (G2) specification, and will replace VirtualMachine from the first generation (G1) to implement Voluntary Preemptive Multitasking (VPM) threads in JavaScript.

The new distributed scheduling system for Tasklets is Tasklet Burst Coscheduling (TBC), an implementation a variant of Concurrent Gang Scheduling called Paired Gang Scheduling. The TBC scheduling algorithm deviates from a traditional task-oriented runqueue design and is unaware of threads, instead representing the multitasking system as a sequence of events in a decentralized Discrete-Event Simulation. The scheduler re-sequences Tasklet events in short “bursts”, a fixed-increment time-progression
